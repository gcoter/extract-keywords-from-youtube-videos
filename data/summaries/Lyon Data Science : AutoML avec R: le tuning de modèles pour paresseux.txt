The speaker discusses their journey in data science, including their experience with Kaggle and learning tools like Rattles and Andrew NJ's machine learning course on Coursera. They recommend a course on mathematics and logistics regulation, which helped them structure their approach to problem-solving. The speaker discusses the birth of auto machine learning and their creation of a script that selects variables and models for data analysis. They also mention their use of the PSO algorithm for machine learning, specifically in predicting the length of petals in flowers. The speaker discusses their use of neural networks and adjusting parameters such as learning weight and number of layers. They mention using auto-ML to find the best results and potentially incorporating transfer learning. They also discuss the optimization of code for machine learning using R and the implementation of parallelization functions.
