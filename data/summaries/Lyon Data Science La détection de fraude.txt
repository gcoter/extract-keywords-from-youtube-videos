The Lyon Data Science Meetup featured a presentation by Quante Ma√Ætrie on fraud detection in subscription services for a telecom operator. The presentation covered the challenges of selection bias, the use of risk scores, and the industrialization of the project. Techniques such as KGB, reclassification iterative, reweighting, and control groups were used to debias the data. The speaker emphasized the importance of effective communication and support from the sponsor to ensure the success of the project. The model used various types of variables to detect fraud, including geographical aspects and financial information. The trade-off between using a simple model that is easily interpretable versus a more complex model that may have better performance but is harder to understand was also discussed.
