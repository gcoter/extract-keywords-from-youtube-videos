DataWalk presented their project on predicting sports race rankings for a client in the sports betting industry who wanted to attract a younger audience by providing a machine that suggests bets. The team used data on each racer and the race itself to create a model that predicts the probability of each racer's ranking in a given race. They developed an innovative hybrid approach involving duels between participants and combining their features to create a new table. The team is working on improving their results by doing feature engineering and creating new variables based on input from their client. They emphasized the importance of data cleaning and feature engineering in their process. The team tested different models, including deep learning with attention models, but found that the most useful variables were the participant's recent performance and the type of race. The model had a 65% accuracy rate for predicting the top three finishers in races, but struggled with predicting the last place finishers. The client's objective was to create an attractive betting platform for young people, rather than creating a model that always wins.
