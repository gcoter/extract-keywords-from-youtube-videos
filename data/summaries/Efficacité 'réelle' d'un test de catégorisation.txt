The Lyon Data Science virtual meet-up featured a presentation by Dominique Marais on the effectiveness of categorization tests, using the example of a disease screening test. Marais emphasized the importance of understanding the distribution of the population being tested and the prior probability of a person being sick when interpreting test results. The group discussed the counterintuitive nature of Bayesian statistics in the context of COVID-19 testing and the importance of explaining these concepts to the public. The speaker also discussed the importance of developing a categorization test for a population of objects and prioritizing the accuracy of negative results in medical testing. Plans for future meetups were discussed.
