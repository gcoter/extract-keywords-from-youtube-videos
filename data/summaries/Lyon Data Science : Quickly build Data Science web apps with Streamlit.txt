The Lyon Data Science association held their first online Meetup where Fanny Leandri and Asselot presented on Streamlit, a framework for building web applications focused on data science. Streamlit is a Python library that allows users to create web applications purely in Python script. The presentation demonstrated an interactive web application using the Udacity dataset, where users can modify the confidence threshold of the YOLO V3 deep learning model to detect different objects. The presentation also discussed the use of machine learning algorithms in risk assessment for transactions in the banking industry. The speaker discussed the capabilities and limitations of Streamlit, a platform for prototyping and demos. They mentioned that Streamlit is still young but has ambitions to be used for production-level applications.
