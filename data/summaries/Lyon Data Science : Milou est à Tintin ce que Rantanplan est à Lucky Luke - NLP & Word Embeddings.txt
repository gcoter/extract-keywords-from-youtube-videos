The article discusses the challenges of natural language processing (NLP) and the importance of understanding the semantics of words. The use of vectors for words allows for mathematical operations and comparisons, making it easier for data scientists to analyze language. The article also discusses the different parameters that can be adjusted in a model for natural language processing, such as the size of the window used to analyze context, the size of the embedding vectors, and the choice of words to predict. The article discusses the use of word embeddings, specifically the Word2Vec approach, to predict the meaning of words based on their context. The speaker discusses their algorithm for predicting words based on context and context based on words, using data from sources such as Wikipedia and other profiles. The speaker discusses the concept of measuring similarity between words and phrases using the cosine similarity measure. The article discusses the challenges of creating a bilingual Wikipedia model that accurately translates words with multiple meanings. The discussion revolves around the polysemy of words and the challenges of separating their different meanings. The speaker discusses the use of a library for generating models in Python, which is based on C for speed.
