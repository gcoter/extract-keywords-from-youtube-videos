The presentation focuses on the changing roles of data scientists and the emergence of machine learning engineering. The speaker discusses the definition of data science and the differences between data scientists and other professions. They also examine the potential for machine learning engineers to replace data scientists in the future. The presentation is divided into three chapters: defining data science, mapping out other professions and expertise, and exploring the impact of new technologies and roles on the field. The speaker discusses the specific challenges of putting machine learning models into production and notes that data engineers are often more mature in this area than data scientists. The speaker also looks at job postings for data science and machine learning engineering positions and notes the percentage of postings that require skills in data engineering, data analysis, business expertise, and DevOps. They find that data engineering is required in around 80% of data science job postings, while data analysis is only required in around 30%. The speaker concludes that data scientists should also learn about DevOps and CICD to stay competitive in the job market.
