The speaker discusses the importance of normalization in data analysis and machine learning, emphasizing the use of techniques such as z-score and geometric z-score. They caution against blindly using black box approaches and stress the importance of understanding the underlying assumptions and potential errors. The speaker also discusses the challenges of using traditional normalization techniques in fields beyond text, such as natural language processing, and encourages further exploration and discovery in the coming years.
