Jeremy Espinas, an engineer at ESCARE, presented a meetup on the impacts of artificial intelligence, covering ethical, societal, environmental, and user interaction impacts. He discussed the four industrial revolutions and the impact of algorithms at a macroscopic and microscopic level, emphasizing the ethical implications of biased data in algorithms. The use of algorithms in recruitment and crime prediction can lead to biases and ethical concerns. The societal impacts of algorithms are also discussed, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the use of AI in China's social credit system. The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) can be seen in various areas, including the ability to rate individuals based on factors such as debt, cheating, and respect for traffic laws. AI also has an environmental impact, with the development of machine learning algorithms requiring significant amounts of energy and resulting in high carbon footprints. The speaker discusses the importance of considering the technical knowledge of the end user when developing machine learning algorithms.
