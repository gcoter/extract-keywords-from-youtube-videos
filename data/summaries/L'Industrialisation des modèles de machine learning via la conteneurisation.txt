The article discusses the industrialization of Amel through machine learning models deployed via containerization in the OpenShift platform. The project involved teams of data engineers, developers, architects, and data scientists with different backgrounds and profiles. The speaker emphasizes the importance of using existing tools and communication to facilitate the deployment of machine learning models. The article discusses the challenges of serializing machine learning models for use in APIs, particularly when dealing with data that differs from the data used to train the model. The author also introduces OpenShift, a platform as a service that allows for easy deployment of applications using containerization technology such as Docker. The article discusses the use of Docker and orchestration technologies like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes to manage containers and deploy applications. The speaker explains that their team focuses on creating predictive models, but it is up to other applications to consume and process the predictions.
